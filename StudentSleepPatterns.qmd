# Introduction

What to include in this section: Describe the provenance of your data. That is, where did you get the data, who collected the data, for what purpose, who/what make up the cases. Explain how your data meet the FAIR and/or CARE Principles. Describe what attributes you will focus your analysis on (mention if they are part of your data sets or if you created them out of your data sets)

# Data Exploration and Research Questions

## Research Question 1

```{yaml}

```

## Research Question 2

After analyzing how sleep duration and physical activity vary by university years, we wanted to see how given two of the attributes for a particular student, how the third would be affected. More specifically, the question we are trying to answer is:

Given the class group of a student (underclassmen or upperclassmen) and their sleep duration, how do their reported levels of physical activity vary?
